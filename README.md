# Forkify Project

A Recipe application

While developing the project I followed MVC (model, view, controller) software architecture with a publisher-subscriber design pattern to build logic in different modules.
The application has the following features \_\_\_

‚úÖ Search functionality: input field to send request to API with searched
keywords.

‚úÖ Display results with pagination

‚úÖ Display recipe with cooking time, servings and ingredients

‚úÖ Change servings functionality: update all ingredients according to
current number of servings

‚úÖ Bookmarking functionality: display list of all bookmarked recipes

‚úÖ User can upload own recipes using an API key

‚úÖ User recipes will automatically be bookmarked

‚úÖ User can only see their own recipes, not recipes from other users

‚úÖ Store bookmark data in the browser using local storage API

‚úÖ On page load, read saved bookmarks from local storage and display

And finally, I deployed the project to Netlify and set up a continuous integration process between GitHub and Netlify. Whenever there are some changes in the repository code, after pushing the code to the remote repository from the local repository then that will automatically trigger a new deployment of the site.

It's really cool as this is the first time I worked with continuous integration.

I had a ton of fun developing the application over the last month.üòç

You can visit the site by hitting the link (please visit the link using your laptop or desktop the application won't be adaptable for all devices, I didn't use there CSS media queries).
